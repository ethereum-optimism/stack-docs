Welcome to OP Stack Hacks, the **highly experimental** region of the OP Stack docs. OP Stack Hacks are an unofficial guide for messing around with the OP Stack. Here youâ€™ll find information about ways that the OP Stack can be modified in interesting ways.

OP Stack Hacks create blockchains that arenâ€™t exactly OP Stack, and may be insecure. Hacked OP Stack chains can break key invariants that are required to interoperate with [the Optimism Superchain](../understand/explainer.md). **Developers of chains that wish to interoperate with [the Optimism Superchain](../understand/explainer.md) should *not* include any hacks**. When in doubt, stick with the official components within [the current release of the OP Stack](../releases/README.md#current-release).

::: warning ðŸš§ OP Stack Hacks are explicitly things that you can do with the OP Stack that are *not* currently intended for production use

OP Stack Hacks are not for the faint of heart. You will not be able to receive significant developer support for OP Stack Hacks â€” be prepared to get your hands dirty and to work without support.
